# Regular expressions in Java programming language

User input validation system using
regular expressions in Java programming language
Scenario:
Suppose you are developing an online registration system
where users must enter information such as username,
email, phone number and password. Your system must check and 
validate these inputs to ensure that the information entered 
conforms to the specified rules. We use regular expressions for this.


## The goal of the project:
Validation of username: Username must contain lowercase or uppercase letters and numbers, and its length must be at least 5 and at most 15 characters.
Email Validation: The email must conform to the standard email template (eg: example@example.com).
Phone Number Validation: Phone number must be entered in international format (eg: +98 912 345 6789).
Password validation: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character, and its length should be between 8 and 20 characters.
